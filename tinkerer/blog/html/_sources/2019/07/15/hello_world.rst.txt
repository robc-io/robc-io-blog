Time to start writing...
========================

Ok, it's just got to start happening.  I've been thinking about doing this for a really long time and I think I have enough to say to finally put it out there on the interwebs worldwide.  I got a ton of notes on various dev ops topics that I want to make public and musings about random stuff and things that it's about time.

I want to open source this all mostly because the documentation I want to post will evolve and I want to take PRs to improve it potentially. I don't know if anyone will take the time but it would be cool to see if the docs I have are in any way authoritative enough to warrant a PR... Anyways, lets give this a shot.
