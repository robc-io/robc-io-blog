This might be the last straw for windows
========================================

Sooooo....

Windows and docker just don't mix well.  I have no idea what they are doing with the whole ``docker-for-windows`` or
``windows containers``, but docker is a linux tool and windows just doesn't seem to jive with it.

The latest came when now, ``localhost`` which accepts self signed TLS on 2375 changed to ``docker.for.win.localhost``.

Seriously, this is just stupid now.  There were all the permissions issues before that when you ran docker behind
active directory joined machines, the whole thing crapped out on the permissions layer. Now renaming the localhost,
really.  Well if that is what they have to do to fix the aweful experience so far, please.

Anger post... We all deserve our time....
